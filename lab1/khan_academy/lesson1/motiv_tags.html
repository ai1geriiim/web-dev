        <strong><em>Nobody’s</em> born <em>smart</em></strong>. We all start at 0. <em>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra</em>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong><em>Nobody’s</em> good at anything at <em>first</em></strong>.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10</strong>.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us</strong>.<br>
        Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn</em>.<br>
        <strong>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall</strong>.<br>

        <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling</strong>.<br>
        <em>Until one day, you walk</em>.<br>
        <strong><em>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next</em></strong>.<br>
        <em>Each wrong answer</em> <em>making your brain</em> a little bit <em>stronger</em>.<br>
        <strong><em>Failing is just</em></strong> another word for <strong><em>growing</em></strong>. And <em>you keep going</em>.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning</strong>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere can understand</em>.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are</em>.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything</strong>.
